# welcome
Every Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. we host a computer programming study group at General Assembly - located at 225 Bush Street 5th floor in San Francisco. At each session participants are presented with three challenge problems. Participants will be given one hour to complete the challenges. Solutions will be presented by participants willing to share their answers with the group. Participants are welcome to use the language of their choice to solve each problem.  Problems test knowledge of data structures, general concepts and algorithms, mathematical concepts, testing and system design and web based challenges. This group is open to the public.  For questions or recommendations please contact Samuel Cabral at samfcabral@gmail.com.  We provide liquid encouragement (beer and wine) to all participants of legal drinking age.  Happy programming!
